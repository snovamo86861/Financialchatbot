 How bots transform the financial industry?


Financial institutions are optimizing themselves for the new generation of tech-savvy users, and financial services chatbots are emerging as the new face of their customer service. 


***Financial services chatbots are highly-efficient, self-sufficient virtual employees***

The constraints of business hours and working days apply to a bank’s physical employees, but not to their virtual counterparts. Chatbots remain functional 24/7, and once set up, they need no human intervention to perform the tasks they’ve been assigned.




- Core message:  Offer the ability to add and compare stocks in a effortless way for everyone.




**Project Description:**


Algorithmic trading bot using machine learning with different signals.

**Methodology:**

 Our Financial  chatbot is created by  using Amazon Lex. The bot is programmed to offer accurate and datailed information on how to diversify their financial portafolio.



       -  The bot should do the following:

       1. Take input like stock name or company name if they want a specific stock to be included in their portfolio.
       
       2. Be able to give price.
       
       3. Say if it is a good buy or not.
       
       4. Say if it is a stock to short or not.
       
       5. Be able to input amount to use in USD.
       
       6. Risk levels for our suggested portfolios.
       
       7. Create different portfolios for different levels of risk.
       
       8. Use NLP to analyse stock sentiment as input for ML to see if it affects stock.
